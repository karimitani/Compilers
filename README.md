# Compilers
Designed and implemented a full-fledged optimizing Java complier using the following steps:
  scanners, 
  parsers, 
  semantic actions,
  code generation
  register allocation,
  instruction scheduling,
  basic optimizations (peephole optimization, strength reduction, constant folding...)
